                <p>
                    I have lived in Pennsylvania, Alaska, and Georgia. While in Alaska, I expanded my experiences by joining the local Paranormal Investigation group I.O.P.I.A. 
                    I have investigated different places and have seen unforgettable things, which helped me expand my knowledge in various fields.

                <p>
                    My interests range from historical facts behind theories expressed in media to UI design and programming. 
                    I enjoy exploring how technology impacts our lives and finding creative ways to enhance user experiences.

            <div className="about-section">
                <h2>Computers and UI Design</h2>
                <p>
                    I first developed my interest in UI design when converting back to a Windows machine from a Mac.
                    I did not like how Windows was set up and strived to make my desktop look and act more like OSX.
                    I learned about a program called Rainmeter and expanded my knowledge in programming, developing my first
                    full custom UI theme through this program. My Rainmeter theme is available 
                    <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/franknmullet/art/Skyrim-Theme-1-0-651760185"

                        className="text-body"> here 
                    </a>

                <h2>Developer Learning Projects</h2>
                <p>
                    In 6 months, I learned and built a fairly complex Windows desktop widget suite themed around the Skyrim video game, 
                    which includes a setup widget that controls almost everything, containing close to 10,000 lines of code using .ini and .inc files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 6 months, I taught myself how to build a multipage webpage using React and Next.js, which included Bootstrap 
                    and a Dungeons and Dragons battle simulator involving a hero and a monster that accurately applied all rules 
                    of the Advanced Special Edition 2 system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In just under 2 calendar years, I progressed from a basic understanding of SQL to being able to create 
                    polished dashboards with at least 3-5 graphs and charts. This involved utilizing highly advanced multi-table 
                    SQL queries with 700+ lines to sort through hundreds of thousands of rows of data in a complex ActiveAdmin setup, 
                    while reducing the data to under 1MB for CSV export.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 60 hours, ChatGPT and I built a single-page app using React and Redux that parses CSV data into a dashboard 
                    featuring 3 custom graphs, an adaptive analysis section, and a display of the CSV data. A portion of that time 
                    was spent going back over the code due to multiple data parsing, and implementing Redux. Another significant 
                    portion was dedicated to learning how to collaborate effectively with ChatGPT on development and troubleshooting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In just a few days, I explored the OpenAI Playground training materials and examples from my brother, 
                    enabling me to start developing fairly advanced custom prompt engineering systems.
