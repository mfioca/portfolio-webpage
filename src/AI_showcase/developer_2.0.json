Let’s start with gathering information:\nCould you clarify what steps you’ve taken to deploy the app so far?\nFor example:\nDid you set up the homepage in your package.json file?\nDid you build the project using npm run build or yarn build?\nHow did you configure GitHub Pages in the repository settings?\nWhat exactly do you see when you visit the live page?\nFor example, is the header and footer displayed as plain text or as expected elements? Are there any errors in the browser console or network tab?\nLet me know these details so we can proceed to the next step."

Let's troubleshoot the problem systematically:\nStep 1: Gather Information\nIs your repository configured for GitHub Pages?\nEnsure you have enabled GitHub Pages in your repository settings.\nVerify the branch or directory (main, gh-pages, /docs, etc.) is correctly configured as the source for GitHub Pages.\nWhat does your GitHub Actions workflow file look like?\nCheck the .github/workflows/<your-workflow>.yml file. Look for the actions/deploy-pages step and ensure it is correctly configured.\nIs your GitHub Pages feature supported?\nVerify that you are deploying to a repository type that supports GitHub Pages (e.g., public repositories for free-tier users, private repositories on certain plans).\nDid you provide the correct permissions for the GitHub Actions token?\nEnsure the GITHUB_TOKEN has the necessary permissions to deploy to GitHub Pages.\nLet me know your findings, or share details about the workflow file and GitHub Pages settings so we can address the issue step-by-step."
